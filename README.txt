Hello, thank you for downloading.
A couple warnings before you start the program.
This will disable the enter key after the reboot is done.
To undo any changes made by RUN, use the UndoChanges.bat file.
The folder will be moved to C:\ under the name CriticalSys. You can find the UndoChanges file there.

Run the RUN.bat file to begin!
